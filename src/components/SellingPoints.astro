                What to Expect at Your New Student Assessment
            </h2>
            <p>
                Each assessment is unique to the individual Golfer, but one can reasonably expect these aspects of a New Student Assessment to take place during your 60 Minute Session.

                <p>
                    The New Student Assessment always starts with the opportunity to get to know your Beach City Golf Club Elite Golf Coaches. This will include a discussion about your goals, physical fitness and current skill level.
